            I'm a student pursuing my majors in Information Science and
            Engineering from Bangalore, India. My interests are inclined towards
            development. As an ardent learner and a creative thinker, I'm always
            open to learning new stuffs and implementing them. I'm currently
            into Web Development and UI/UX Designing. Oh! and I'm a Potter-Head
            as well.ðŸ˜‰
